JS
Implement a function that accepts 2 arrays of numbers as arguments and returns a single array with all the numbers from both arrays,
sorted in ascending order.

The function should throw an exception if the arguments that are passed are not arrays of numbers.


REACT
Using REACT and an API such as https://ipapi.co/json/, create a widget that displays a users IP address and country. Make the API calls asynchronous 

In your code, split the component into separate files, one for the IP, one for the country (values taken from the API). You should have 4 files.

The display for the country should show a flag of that nation using a Pseudo element from CSS

Once you have the data and displayed it, 
create a PostModel and post it to an API end point, 
checking for responses (success and error), 
and then confirming either way on the console. 
Use a mock endpoint - this is more about seeing the code to achieve these ends.
